# Data-Integration-and-Predictive-Analysis-System-with-Chatbot-for-Insurance-Brokerage

This end of study project focuses on developing an advanced system for data integration and predictive analysis with chatbot tailored to the insurance brokerage industry. The primary objective was to enhance data management and decision-making processes by designing and deploying customized Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and interactive dashboards, accompanied by a chatbot for analyzing these KPIs.
The primary tasks included integrating data from MariaDB to SQL Server using Talend to create a solid and clean data warehouse, developing a dynamic dashboard with Power BI, creating a chatbot for KPI analysis using NLP techniques, implementing predictive analytics to anticipate market trends through Machine Learning algorithms, and developing a Flask web application to showcase all these tasks, including the integrated dashboard, chatbot, and predictive analysis components.


There are the steps of realising the project :

- SQL and Database Management with Microsoft SQL Server and MariaDB.
- Data Integration: Using Talend to integrate data from MariaDB to SQL Server, creating a solid and clean data warehouse.
- Dashboard Development: Designing a dynamic dashboard with Power BI to visualize the KPIs.
- Predictive Analysis: Implementing predictive models with Machine Learning algorithms to forecast market trends.
- Chatbot Development: Creating a chatbot using NLP techniques to analyze the KPIs from the dashboard.
- Web Application: Developing a web application with Flask to integrate the dashboard, chatbot, and predictive analysis components.


Technologies Used :

- Microsoft SQL Server: For managing and querying the integrated data warehouse.
- DBeaver: For database management and SQL query development.
- Talend: For ETL and data integration tasks.
- Microsoft Power BI: For creating interactive data visualizations.
- Python: For data extraction, predictive analysis, and chatbot development.
- Flask: For developing the web application.
- Machine Learning: For predictive analytics and trend forecasting.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): For developing the interactive chatbot.
- Chatbot Development: For integrating interactive features within the web application.
